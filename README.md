Pantree is an intelligent retail recommendation system designed to personalize the shopping experience through automated analysis and reasoning. The frontend collects a user’s purchase history and sends it to an AWS SageMaker endpoint, which coordinates multiple AI components: a frequency analysis module identifies products frequently bought enough to qualify for a “Subscribe & Save” program, while a Llama NIM model consults a vector database—powered by a retrieval embedding NIM—to find semantically related or complementary products. By combining statistical analysis with semantic reasoning, the system delivers tailored subscription and product recommendations that adapt to each user’s buying habits.
